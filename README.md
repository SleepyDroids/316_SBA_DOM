# SBA 316: The Document Object Model ðŸ’¾

Created an interactive D20 die that gives a random die number on each click of a button. Also provides options to roll with advantage (two d20s, taking the highest roll) and with disadvatange (two d20s and taking the lowest roll).

Also includes a previous roll log intended to show the user the output number values of the last 10 rolls executed by the user. 

There is also a form to add the user's character's name (typical for tabletop games) for additional interactivty and customization.

Last, but not least: added a dice sound and dice animation upon button clicks for immersion and funsies. âœ¨

# Requirements Achieved âœ…

- Cached an element using both selectElementById and querySelector.
- Utilized the parent-child-sibling relationship multiple times to navigate between elements at least once.
- Iterated over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.  
- Created many elements using createElement.
- Utilized appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. 
- Utilized the DocumentFragment interface and also utilized it to append content to the DOM from inside of a function. 
- Modified the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
- Modified the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions used the style or classList properties. 
- Registered at least two different event listeners and created the associated event handler functions.
- Used at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods. 
- Included at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation and with DOM event-based validation. 
- Modified at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction. 
- Ensured that my program ran without errors. 
- Commited to the git repo at least 10 times.
- Included the README file (that's this!)

# Reflection ðŸ’­

- This was initially a project I was working on solo, but then decided it would work well as a part of the SBA 316's requirements. 
- This didn't 100% turn out the way I wanted it to, but it's closer than what I started with. My intention is to, at some point, add the second die for disadvatange and advantage rolls and have them both displayed to the user. As well as a special indicator for which roll was highest or lowest. 
- I also want to be able to do something with localStorage and have the rolls and character name be kept in case the user wishes to return to the dice roller again and not have to reinsert the same information (and save their rolls as someone might save inbetween D&D sessions for example). 
- Also want to add more dice color options, something similar to a 'theme' functionality. 
- I know I need to clean up the code and refactor the fucntions using logic so that it's easier for me to manipululate the outputs in the log run. Same goes for reducing the number of event listeners. 
- Overall, I feel like this ultimately became a decent template of an idea I had and one I want to expand upon in the future. ie. Adding different dice types, saving a character's data in terms of their class (and to be able to add modifiers depending on the tabletop), and even a place to store multiple characters with their respective rolls. 
- And I concede that's an ambitious ask as I am still learning, but I want to keep working on this project if for no other reason than continuing to learn and build up my skills with the document object model. 
- I also desperately want to clean up the design and CSS. It's no where near where I imagined in my head, but I know I can get it there.
